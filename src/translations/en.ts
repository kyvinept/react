  Description:
    "I have started working as an iOS developer. I have worked in a large company and have worked on projects from small ones in a small team (about a few people) and large ones (about 30 people). Later I have learned Java Script to improve my skills in mobile development and have learned React Native. I love to advance and to learn something new. I have learned React and Node JS for working on projects by myself. Freelance projects allowed me to gain commercial experience with this technology and improve in this.",
