  Description:
    "I started my journey as an iOS developer. I worked in a large company and carried out projects, starting with small ones in a small team for a few people, and large ones, in which there were about 30 people. Later I learned Java Script to further improve my mobile development and learned React Native. I love to improve and am constantly learning something new. This is how I learned React and Node JS so that I could work on projects myself. Freelance projects allowed me to gain commercial experience with technology data and improve in them.",
